        <a href="https://rapidapi.com/hub" target="blank">RapidApi</a> is a hub
        for finding all sorts of APIs. Be careful and check the docs of any you
        are interested in.

          >The Reddit API</a

        is a surprisingly robust and user-friendly API for tons of data from
        Reddit. I know, the docs look like garbage. But they are super helpful.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        If you think of a website that might have a data set you need (like
        Fandango or Spotify), try googling the website name with "api." You'd be
        surprised what's out there.

        <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="blank">Bulma</a> works a lot like
        Bootstrap. The classes have similar naming conventions and the columns
        system for responsive layout design will be pretty familiar. Bulma is
        pretty simple and doesn't have any fancy components that require
        JavaScript. It's so simple to use, I used it to make this!

      <h3 class="subtitle">
        <a href="https://materializecss.com/" target="blank">MaterializeCSS </a
        >was made by Google and works a little bit differently from Bootstrap or
        Bulma. It doesn't have a system for handling responsive layouts. But it
        does have a lot of super cool components that use JavaScript with CSS
        for some really sleek UI. If you've got a handle on media queries and
        want to challenge yourself, check it out!

          >Semantic UI </a
        >is an extremely robust framework with some of the best docs I have ever
        used. It has more components than MaterializeCSS or Bulma. Like
        MaterializeCSS, it uses JavaScript to handle some of the flashier stuff.
        Semantic UI doesn't have a column system the way Bulma or Bootstrap does.
