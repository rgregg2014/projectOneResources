## Resources Page for Project One

Congrats, you've made it through a whole month of bootcamp! Time to put your new skills to use with an awesome collaborative project. These assignments have a lot of moving parts, so I've made you this reference page to bookmark to keep it all straight.

Work hard and commit often!
